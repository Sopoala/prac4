  <p>My Heart Garden makes exuberant use of hot chillies, garlic, lemon grass and ginger. These hot and spicy dishes have a unique character of their own which distinguishes them from the cooking of other parts of South-East Asia. Meals are prepared in the traditional manner with several dishes being served simultaneously, complementing each other in texture, flavour, aroma and colour. Only the freshest ingredients are used. These are selected and blended with care to create a harmonious result.</p>
